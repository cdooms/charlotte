### Visual and functional remarks (Round 1):
  * fix scss linting errors, I readded it to the grunt tasks. (now you can see where you made mistakes) this task only runs on `grunt`, not `grunt watch`
  * Input field password [image](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/7422112/screenshots/Screen%20Shot%202015-01-29%20at%2016.07.53.png)
  * Hover color on buttons [example](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/7422112/screenshots/Screen%20Shot%202015-01-29%20at%2016.09.31.png)
  * Text Area placeholder [image](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/7422112/screenshots/Screen%20Shot%202015-01-29%20at%2016.13.16.png)
  * Use al the space you have [image](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/7422112/screenshots/Screen%20Shot%202015-01-29%20at%2016.14.33.png)
  * h5 should be replaced with label with id that referes to input [image](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/7422112/screenshots/Screen%20Shot%202015-01-29%20at%2016.16.00.png)
  * always keep in mind where much text may show up, GOOD JOB [image](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/7422112/screenshots/Screen%20Shot%202015-01-29%20at%2016.17.44.png)
  * when you deal with buttons, you should avoid the button tag :D, unless it is for a form submit or something that can be visualized as a button [image](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/7422112/screenshots/Screen%20Shot%202015-01-29%20at%2016.19.32.png) use <a> tags instead because they do not have a default look in browsers. Buttons are mostly used only in form contexts
  * city.png should be a background [image](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/7422112/screenshots/Screen%20Shot%202015-01-29%20at%2016.26.44.png)
  * when you deal with rounded corners on images, you should use border radius on a rect image [image](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/7422112/screenshots/Screen%20Shot%202015-01-29%20at%2016.28.36.png)
  * you have styled the li and the a tag within that li [image](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/7422112/screenshots/Screen%20Shot%202015-01-29%20at%2016.34.50.png)
  * when you add icons they should be centered [image](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/7422112/screenshots/Screen%20Shot%202015-01-29%20at%2016.35.52.png)
  * 2014 should be text
  * line bug [image](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/7422112/screenshots/Screen%20Shot%202015-01-29%20at%2016.52.25.png)
  * remove grid background helper
  * add box-shadow [image](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/7422112/screenshots/Screen%20Shot%202015-01-29%20at%2016.53.01.png)
  * no hover state [image](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/7422112/screenshots/Screen%20Shot%202015-01-29%20at%2016.56.30.png)

### Things you can do to bump up the performance and make it more functional
  * use custom fonts [image](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/7422112/screenshots/Screen%20Shot%202015-01-29%20at%2016.30.24.png)
  * use svg or icon font for all the icons to minimize requests
  * make it responsive
  * use animation on hovers
  * integrate video
  * integrate graphic library [chartjs](http://www.chartjs.org/)
  * integrate dropdown [drop down](http://local.dev/charlotte/index.html) 
  * make 2014 the actual year so that it updates when we are in 2016, with javascript.
  * integrate tag component [image](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/7422112/screenshots/Screen%20Shot%202015-01-29%20at%2016.54.49.png)
  * integrate real tweets with twitter api of hugh jackman [image](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/7422112/screenshots/Screen%20Shot%202015-01-29%20at%2016.55.35.png)
  * Xbrowser ie8 :D

### keep up the good work !

When you develop one of the above points you should use git branching, after a branch/feature is complete I will do a code review on it.
Maybe you should solve all the issues in round 1 in a branch round-1-issues
